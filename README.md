## Weather Forecasting and Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning
### Abstract
The agriculture sector is profoundly affected by climatic changes, necessitating a deep understanding of the relationship between weather patterns and agricultural outcomes. This project employs sophisticated machine learning techniques, including time series analysis and ensemble modeling, to predict weather patterns and agricultural yields. By leveraging historical data, the project aims to provide proactive insights for risk reduction and strategic agricultural planning, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and resilient agricultural practices in the face of climate change.

### Introduction
#### Background and Motivation
Agriculture relies heavily on climate conditions, and understanding the intricate interplay between weather patterns and agricultural trends is crucial for informed decision-making. With climate change presenting growing challenges, including temperature fluctuations and extreme weather events, the need to adapt agricultural practices is more pressing than ever.

#### Objectives and Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

 - Unearth correlations and patterns linking weather variables with agricultural outcomes.
 - Deliver actionable insights for farmers and stakeholders within the agricultural sector.
 - Construct advanced machine learning models to forecast crop yields and weather patterns.
